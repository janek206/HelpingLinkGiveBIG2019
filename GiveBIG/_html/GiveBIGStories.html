              <p>I have been living in the U.S. for less than a year. Before coming to Helping Link, I was still getting adjusted 
                  to this new life. Thankfully, my daughter referred over to Helping Link as she herself also took an ESL class
                  there a few years prior. It was at Helping Link where I met a lot of very nice tutors who were not only helpful
                  but also very relatable. Although, my English still has some progress to go, I have been able to retain basic
                  words and initiate a few conversations. While I had studied English in Vietnam, a major accident left me with
                  impaired memory. However, through Helping Link’s classes and patience, I have been able to make more progress
                  than I thought I could have done. For that, I am very grateful for the opportunity Helping Link has given me
                  and allowing me to spend my time to learn a new language in this new life.</p>

                <p>
                    I started my first day at Helping Link back in July 2017. English has been my biggest hurdle thus far
                    as I have just immigrated to the U.S. from Vietnam a few months before with my family. After hearing about
                    Helping Link from a few family members, I decided it was time for me to learn English and hopefully be able
                    to communicate to my extended family better, especially those who have grown up here. The best thing I like
                    about the ESL classes here about Helping Link is that the lessons are interactive and everyone in class is
                    very friendly and welcoming. I would like to continue attending class to gain better knowledge and improve
                    my English fluency.

                    I first came to Helping Link about two years ago to learn English just like everyone else. I found that
                    grasping the language myself was too much for me to communicate fluently. During the quarter, I really
                    liked my teacher, Leilani, as she helped me a lot. I found lessons involving topics such as
                    transportation and banking very valuable and applicable to my life here in the U.S.. I learned a lot of
                    practical skills and words which helped me become more independent and resourceful. Taking ESL at Helping
                    Link has motivated me to learn more.
